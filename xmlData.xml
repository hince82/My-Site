     Hi! I'm an IT Teacher in Istanbul. I'm married and have a kid. I designed this site to introduce myself and my skills and 
        hosted in my wordpress domain.

        I had teached javascript,c# and web design tools for 12 years in a 
        high school. Nowadays i work in a huge primary school with 130 teachers and consulting them about tech tools and solving 
        IT problems. Recently decide an improvement in my career and got a C# certificate from Microsoft early this year.
        Altough i'm a newbee at professional developing i have more than enough work experience and 
        i have the passion and the discipline to learn fast.
        I also have a Bulgarian (European) citizenship so i 
        can travel and work anywhere in Europe,UK and Switzerland even though i work in Turkey.
